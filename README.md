# Cat Poo Detector

## Problem

If you've ever been in one of these situations, this is the repository for you!

1.  You want to have a lazy morning in bed but you need to be sure that the cat hasn't used their litter tray during the night (Meaning they'll end up using the floor next time).  How can I watch Youtube safely in bed whilst the sword of potential cat poo hangs over my head?
2.  You are visually impaired AND have COVID19 (so you can't smell... or taste... a thing).  How can I know if the litter tray needs cleaning?

## Solution?

Cat Poo Detector!  Simply build the following device, upload this project to it, and install it near the cat's litter throne.
